## sample questions the interface will be able to answer

1. Which PFAS compounds are present in house dust /tap water/human serum in U.S. homes and at what concentrations?
2. Which substances are detected in paired/multiple environmental and/or biomonitoring samples (e.g., the concentrations of PFOA or PFOS in dust/drinking water/serum at the same location)?
3. How many sources are within 5/10 km from location of dust/tap water/human serum measurements?
4. How many PFAS compounds are detected above detection limit in certain locations (e.g., in NC or in NC + SC)?
5. What percentage of tap water samples/dust have detectable PFAS?
6. What percentage of tap water/dust samples contain a distinctive mixture of PFAS compounds (e.g., containing both PFOS and PFOA)?
